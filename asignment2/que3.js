/* 3. You need to write a function findTax() that takes a number type variable as an argument which is the salary of a person. You need to calculate the tax amount on his salary by using the Js switch control flow. The tax rates are given below.
if 500000 >= salary > 0 then 0% tax on the entire salary.
If 1000000 >= salary > 500000 then 10% tax on the entire salary.
If 1500000 >= salary > 1000000 then 20% tax on the entire salary.
If the salary > 1500000 then 30% tax on the entire salary.*/

function findTax(salary) {
    let taxRate;
    let taxAmount;

    switch (true) {
      case (salary > 0 && salary <= 500000):
        taxRate = 0;
        break;
      case (salary > 500000 && salary <= 1000000):
        taxRate = 0.1;
        break;
      case (salary > 1000000 && salary <= 1500000):

        taxRate = 0.3;
        break;
      default:
        return "Invalid salary amount";
    }

    taxAmount = salary * taxRate;
    return taxAmount;

  console.log(findTax(100000));
